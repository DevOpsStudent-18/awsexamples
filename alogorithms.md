# List of algorithms and their descriptions

## 1. Linear Regression
- **Description**: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.
- **Use Case**: Predicting continuous values, such as house prices or stock prices.
## 2. Logistic Regression
- **Description**: A statistical method for predicting binary classes. The outcome is usually a probability that the given input point belongs to a certain class.
- **Use Case**: Binary classification tasks, such as spam detection or disease diagnosis.
## 3. Decision Trees
- **Description**: A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes.
- **Use Case**: Classification and regression tasks, such as customer segmentation or risk assessment.
## 4. Random Forest
- **Description**: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the mode of their classes or mean prediction.
- **Use Case**: High-dimensional data classification, such as image recognition or fraud detection.
## 5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Description**: A supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis. It finds the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes.
- **Use Case**: Text classification, image classification, and bioinformatics.
## 6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Description**: A non-parametric method used for classification and regression. It predicts the output based on the k-nearest training examples in the feature space.
- **Use Case**: Pattern recognition, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection.
## 7. XGBoost
- **Description**: An optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable.
- **Use Case**: Structured/tabular data tasks, such as credit scoring and customer churn prediction.
## 8. SKLearn
- **Description**: A Python module integrating a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for medium-scale supervised and unsupervised problems.
- **Use Case**: General-purpose machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
## 9. TensorFlow
- **Description**: An open-source platform for machine learning that provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources.
- **Use Case**: Deep learning tasks, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.
## 10. PyTorch
- **Description**: An open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.
- **Use Case**: Research and production in deep learning, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing tasks.
